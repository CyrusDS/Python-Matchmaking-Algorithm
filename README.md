This zip contains two things
1. My course research for a project in Discrete Mathematics
that I did relating to Matchmaking systems, League was an example focus.
2. Code for the program made for the research project. Code was made in about 1 day
specifically for the project and is just a basic implementation to aid the project,
but was pretty interesting overall still.

I did this project in December of 2021, before CQ was even really a thing,
mainly cause I was interested in this sort of thing and thought League
would be a good topic to look at.
